# Video Tour Garden Planning

Using video tours of your garden space to improve planning accuracy and create customized growing strategies.

## Overview

A walking video tour of your garden allows AI analysis to extract detailed spatial, environmental, and infrastructure information that goes far beyond what written descriptions can capture. This creates more accurate, realistic, and customized garden plans.

## What Can Be Analyzed From Video

### Physical Layout & Measurements

**Spatial Information:**
- Bed dimensions and spacing (estimated from visual cues and narration)
- Container locations, types, and sizes
- Path widths and accessibility
- Vertical growing structures (trellises, cages, stakes, fences)
- Distance relationships between garden areas
- Overall footprint and available expansion space

**Why This Matters:**
- Accurate plant spacing recommendations
- Realistic yield expectations based on actual space
- Better succession planting schedules
- Identification of underutilized areas

### Sun Exposure Analysis

**Observable Patterns:**
- Which areas receive direct sun vs partial shade vs full shade
- Buildings, trees, or structures casting shadows
- Shadow patterns at time of filming (helps estimate daily sun arc)
- Directional orientation clues (north/south/east/west)
- Seasonal considerations (if filmed at different times)

**Why This Matters:**
- Match sun-loving vs shade-tolerant crops to specific locations
- Understand why certain areas perform better/worse
- Plan for summer vs winter sun angles
- Optimize heat-sensitive crop placement

### Soil & Drainage Assessment

**Visible Indicators:**
- Soil type (clay, sandy, loamy, amended)
- Soil color and texture
- Existing mulch or amendments
- Wet spots, puddles, or drainage issues
- Slope and grading patterns
- Erosion or compaction problems

**Why This Matters:**
- Recommend appropriate soil amendments by location
- Identify drainage solutions needed
- Suggest crops suited to existing soil conditions
- Plan irrigation based on water retention

### Infrastructure & Resources

**Key Elements:**
- Water sources (spigots, hoses, irrigation)
- Hose reach and coverage
- Electrical outlets (for timers, grow lights, tools)
- Fence or barrier condition and height
- Existing irrigation systems (drip, soaker, sprinklers)
- Tool storage and workspace proximity
- Compost bins or amendment storage
- Rainwater collection

**Why This Matters:**
- Design irrigation systems that work with existing infrastructure
- Plan electrical needs (timers, lighting)
- Recommend realistic amendments based on storage capacity
- Optimize workflow and reduce physical strain

### Current Garden State

**Observable Conditions:**
- What's currently planted and thriving
- Problem areas (weeds, bare spots, failed crops, disease)
- Successful companion plantings
- Spacing issues (overcrowded vs sparse planting)
- Plant health and vigor
- Pest or disease evidence
- Mulch coverage and condition

**Why This Matters:**
- Learn from what's already working
- Avoid repeating past failures in the same locations
- Build on successful combinations
- Address chronic problem areas proactively

### Microclimate Identification

**Environmental Clues:**
- Hot spots (near walls, pavement, south-facing areas)
- Cool pockets (under tree canopy, north-facing)
- Wind exposure or protected areas
- Heat reflection from structures (buildings, fences)
- Moisture retention zones
- Frost pockets (low areas where cold air settles)

**Why This Matters:**
- Place heat-loving crops in hot spots (tomatoes, peppers, melons)
- Use cool areas for heat-sensitive greens
- Protect tender plants from wind
- Plan for frost protection in vulnerable zones
- Optimize growing conditions for each crop

## How Video Improves Planning

### 1. Space Optimization

**Accurate Capacity Planning:**
- Calculate realistic plant counts based on actual bed sizes
- Identify gaps and underutilized corners
- Suggest vertical growing where space is limited
- Plan succession plantings that actually fit

**Example:**
Instead of "plant 6 tomato plants," recommend "3 tomatoes in Bed 1 south end (8 sq ft available), 3 in large containers by back fence (observed in video)."

### 2. Customized Recommendations

**Location-Specific Advice:**
- Reference actual structures: "Near the back fence" vs vague directions
- Work with existing setup: "Use the south-facing wall for heat-loving peppers"
- Integrate with infrastructure: "Install drip line from existing spigot, 25ft reach observed"

**Durham-Specific Adaptations:**
- Identify shaded areas for heat refuge during humid heat waves
- Spot drainage issues critical for Durham's heavy summer rains
- Recognize clay soil areas needing extra amendment

### 3. Problem Prevention

**Proactive Design:**
- Spot poor air circulation areas (disease pressure risk)
- Identify overcrowding before planting
- Plan paths to avoid soil compaction
- Ensure adequate access for maintenance
- Prevent water pooling in low spots

**Example:**
"Bed 2 shows limited air flow due to fence proximity - space plants wider, avoid dense plantings susceptible to fungal disease in Durham's humidity."

### 4. Realistic Expectations

**Grounded Planning:**
- Yield estimates based on actual available space
- Work/maintenance time considering layout efficiency
- Budget for amendments based on visible soil needs
- Irrigation requirements aligned with water source access

**Example:**
"Based on observed 65 sq ft total growing space, target 100-150 lbs tomatoes (not 600 lbs)" or "Three small beds 15ft from water source - budget for 50ft soaker hose."

### 5. Integration with Existing Success

**Build on What Works:**
- Continue successful companion plantings observed
- Expand working layouts to other areas
- Learn from healthy vs struggling plants in different zones
- Preserve beneficial microclimates

## How to Record an Effective Planning Video

### Basic Guidelines

**Equipment:**
- Any smartphone camera (1080p or better)
- Horizontal/landscape orientation preferred
- Steady hands or gimbal/stabilizer if available

**Length:**
- 3-10 minutes typical for most home gardens
- Longer OK for complex or large spaces
- Multiple shorter videos (one per area) also work

### Recording Technique

**1. Overview First**
- Start with wide shot showing entire garden from one vantage point
- Slowly pan 360° to capture context
- Narrate: "This is the whole backyard, garden is along the back fence, about 30x40ft total"

**2. Systematic Tour**
- Walk through each garden area methodically
- Move slowly - give camera time to focus
- Hold still on important features for 3-5 seconds
- Follow a logical path (clockwise, bed by bed, front to back)

**3. Show Scale**
- Place hand next to beds for size reference
- Walk the length/width of beds to show dimensions
- Include measuring tape or known objects (5-gallon bucket) if helpful

**4. Multiple Angles**
- Film each bed/area from at least 2 angles
- Get close-ups of soil, existing plants, infrastructure
- Step back for context shots showing relationships between areas

**5. Capture Details**

**Infrastructure:**
- Zoom in on water spigots, electrical outlets
- Show hose length and reach
- Film irrigation systems, drip lines, timers
- Capture fence height, trellis structures

**Soil & Drainage:**
- Close-ups of soil texture and color
- Any wet spots, puddles, or drainage issues
- Existing mulch or amendments
- Compost bins or amendment storage

**Existing Plants:**
- What's currently growing (even if it's weeds)
- Healthy vs struggling areas
- Successful combinations
- Problem spots

**Sunlight:**
- Film at specific time: "This is 10am, you can see the shade pattern"
- Note which areas are sunny vs shaded
- Point camera toward sun to show direction
- Film on a clear day if possible

### Narration Tips

**What to Say:**
- **Orientation**: "This is the south-facing bed"
- **Dimensions**: "This bed is about 4 feet by 8 feet"
- **Sun exposure**: "This area gets full sun until 3pm, then shade from the house"
- **Soil notes**: "This is heavy clay, that's amended raised bed soil"
- **Water**: "The spigot is here, hose reaches about 50 feet"
- **History**: "Tomatoes did great here last year, cucumbers failed in this corner"
- **Problems**: "This low spot always puddles after rain"
- **Structures**: "This is a 6-foot fence, good for climbing beans"

**What NOT to Worry About:**
- Perfect cinematography
- Professional narration
- Editing or retakes
- Background noise or messiness
- Showing garden in "perfect" condition

### Timing Considerations

**Best Times to Film:**
- **Mid-morning (9-11am)**: Good lighting, shows morning sun patterns
- **Mid-afternoon (2-4pm)**: Shows afternoon shade patterns
- **Multiple times**: Ideal if you can film same areas at different times to show sun arc

**Seasonal Timing:**
- **Before planting season**: Shows bare space, easier to see layout
- **Peak growing season**: Shows what thrives where
- **After harvest**: Shows infrastructure without foliage
- **Multiple seasons**: Captures seasonal sun angle changes

**When to Update:**
- Major infrastructure changes (new beds, irrigation)
- After first growing season (learn from experience)
- When planning significant expansions
- If something is chronically not working

## Integration with Planning Documents

### Updates to Garden Setup (planning/garden-setup.md)

**Enhanced Detail:**
- Actual measurements vs estimates
- Precise sun exposure hours by bed
- Documented microclimates
- Infrastructure locations mapped

**Example Addition:**
```markdown
## Bed 1 - South Raised Bed
- **Dimensions**: 4' x 8' (32 sq ft) - measured from video
- **Location**: Along back fence, south-facing
- **Sun**: Full sun 8am-5pm (9 hours direct), observed 10am filming
- **Soil**: Amended raised bed soil, dark and loose, well-draining
- **Water**: 15ft from spigot, within easy hose reach
- **Microclimate**: Hot spot, south wall reflects heat, ideal for heat-lovers
- **Notes**: Tomatoes thrived here in 2025, visible in video
```

### Refined Strategy (planning/YYYY/strategy.md)

**Location-Specific Plans:**
Replace generic "plant tomatoes" with "plant 3 Cherokee Purple tomatoes in Bed 1 south end (hot microclimate observed, 8 sq ft available, thrived there in 2025)"

**Realistic Quantities:**
Adjust expected yields based on actual space: "Bed 1 (32 sq ft) + 4 large containers (6 sq ft ea) = 56 sq ft tomato space = ~150-250 lbs expected (vs generic 600 lb estimate)"

**Infrastructure-Aware:**
"Install 30ft soaker hose from back spigot (observed in video) to cover Beds 1-2, run on WiFi timer at outlet near back door"

### Experiment Design (experiments/)

**Controlled Variables:**
Video shows exactly which areas to use for control vs treatment groups with same sun/soil/water conditions

**Example:**
```markdown
## Experiment: Shade Cloth for Tomatoes

### Setup
- **Control**: 3 Cherokee Purple in Bed 1 west half (full sun, 9 hrs observed)
- **Treatment**: 3 Cherokee Purple in Bed 1 east half with 30% shade cloth
- **Controlled Variables**: Same bed, same soil, same spigot access
- **Rationale**: Video shows both areas identical except shade cloth placement
```

## Example Use Cases

### Use Case 1: First-Time Garden Planning

**Scenario**: Planning first vegetable garden, want to maximize limited space.

**Video Tour Captures:**
- 15' x 20' sunny area along fence
- Heavy clay soil visible
- Spigot 30ft away
- Afternoon shade from neighbor's tree on east third

**Analysis Results:**
- Recommend 2 raised beds (4x8 each) in full sun area
- Skip east third due to shade, use for shade-tolerant herbs
- Budget for soil amendments (8 cu yd compost for clay)
- Plan drip irrigation from spigot with 40ft main line

**Outcome**: Realistic plan fitted to actual space, budget, and constraints.

### Use Case 2: Improving Existing Garden

**Scenario**: Some areas thrive, others struggle - want to understand why.

**Video Tour Captures:**
- Tomatoes struggling in north bed
- Peppers thriving in south containers
- Wet spot in bed 2 after rain
- Great airflow in bed 3

**Analysis Results:**
- North bed only gets 4 hours sun (not 6+) - wrong for tomatoes
- South containers are hot microclimate perfect for peppers
- Bed 2 drainage issue causing root problems
- Bed 3 good for disease-prone crops due to air circulation

**Recommendations:**
- Move tomatoes to hot microclimate area
- Use north bed for leafy greens
- Add drainage to bed 2 or switch to raised containers
- Plant cucurbits in bed 3 (airflow helps prevent powdery mildew)

**Outcome**: Evidence-based solutions to chronic problems.

### Use Case 3: Scaling Up Production

**Scenario**: Want to increase yields, unsure where to expand.

**Video Tour Captures:**
- Current beds are full
- 10' x 12' unused area visible
- Strong fence for vertical growing
- Good sun exposure

**Analysis Results:**
- Add third raised bed in unused area (4x8)
- Vertical growing on fence (pole beans, peas, cucumbers)
- Underutilized containers can be relocated to better sun

**Expansion Plan:**
- New bed adds 32 sq ft
- Fence vertical space adds ~40 sq ft equivalent
- 6 repositioned containers add 18 sq ft
- Total expansion: 90 sq ft (nearly doubling production)

**Outcome**: Maximized space without guessing or over-committing.

## Limitations & Considerations

### What Video Can't Show

**Hidden Information:**
- Soil composition below surface (requires soil test)
- Drainage below ground (unless problems are visible)
- Underground utilities or obstacles
- Pest populations (unless visible during filming)
- Future construction or tree growth impacts

**Variable Conditions:**
- Sun patterns change seasonally (winter vs summer sun angle)
- One day's weather doesn't show drought/flood issues
- Single time-of-day filming misses full sun arc
- Garden changes over growing season

**Solutions:**
- Combine video with soil testing for subsurface info
- Film at different times/seasons if possible
- Mention known issues in narration even if not visible
- Update video as garden evolves

### Privacy & Security

**What's Captured:**
- Your property layout and features
- Surrounding context (neighbor's yards, buildings)
- Potentially identifiable information

**Considerations:**
- Videos stay local unless you choose to share
- Can blur or avoid filming sensitive areas
- Narration can omit specific addresses
- Focus camera on garden areas, not beyond property
