- **Average Last Frost**: Mid-April
- **Average First Frost**: Mid-November
- **Soil Type**: Clay-heavy red soil (native)
- **Climate Characteristics**: Hot, humid summers; mild winters

## Garden Spaces

### Raised Beds
- **Bed 1 (3x12)**:
  - Dimensions: 3ft x 12ft (36 sq ft)
  - Location: Backyard at 3301 Courtland Drive
  - Sun exposure: 5-6 hours per day at peak summer
  - Soil mix: Topsoil with some compost (needs amendment)

- **Bed 2 (3x9)**:
  - Dimensions: 3ft x 9ft (27 sq ft)
  - Location: Backyard at 3301 Courtland Drive
  - Sun exposure: 5-6 hours per day at peak summer
  - Soil mix: Topsoil with some compost (needs amendment)

- **Bed 3 (Oddly shaped)**:
  - Dimensions: ~16 sq ft
  - Location: Backyard at 3301 Courtland Drive
  - Sun exposure: 5-6 hours per day at peak summer
  - Soil mix: Topsoil with some compost (needs amendment)

**Total raised bed space**: ~79 sq ft

### Containers
- **Quantity**: 10-20 containers, most around 1 cubic foot in size
- **Location**: Backyard, various locations
- **Sun exposure**: 5-6 hours at peak summer, some slightly less, some slightly more
- **Notes**: Well-aerated containers performed better for sweet potatoes than less-aerated ones

### Other Growing Spaces
- **3-foot chain link fence**: Largely but not entirely shaded, could support climbing plants

## Infrastructure & Resources

### Water Access
- **Current setup**: Mix of sprinkler and hand-watering with hose
- **Planned**: Would like to set up soaker hoses
- **Water availability**: Standard residential access

### Livestock
- **Chickens**: 9 chickens on site
- **Benefits**: Chicken manure available for garden use; black soldier fly larvae from compost fed to chickens

### Composting
- **Setup**: Tray system that grows black soldier fly larvae (fed to chickens)
- **Output**: Does not produce much finished compost
- **Plan**: Will need to buy compost for amendments

## Time & Maintenance

### Available Time
- **Weekly time available**: ~10 hours per week during growing season
- **Peak busy seasons**: TBD

### Physical Considerations
- None noted

## Growing Experience

### Seasons Completed
- **At this location**: Nearly one full season completed
- **Previous experience**: TBD

### Past Successes
**Peppers** (excellent performers):
- Purple bell peppers
- Banana peppers
- Jalapeños
- Poblanos

**Other vegetables**:
- Tomatillos (grew well)
- Sweet potatoes (moderate success - better in well-aerated containers)

**Herbs** (grew very well):
- Basil
- Cilantro
- Parsley
- Marjoram
- Thyme
- Rosemary
- Thai basil
- Bee balm
- Lemon verbena
- Lemongrass

**Flowers**:
- Marigolds (thrived, still alive)

### Past Challenges
**Crops that struggled**:
- Melons (failure to produce)
- Berries (failure to produce)
- Squash (failure to produce)
- Cucumbers (failure to produce)

**Possible causes**:
- Late start to the season
- Disease issues (suspected)
- Extreme heat during summer
- May need better variety selection for heat tolerance

### Lessons Learned
- Well-aerated containers are important for root crops like sweet potatoes
- Sun exposure (5-6 hours) is adequate for peppers, tomatillos, and herbs
- Need to start earlier in the season
- Heat-tolerant varieties may be necessary for Durham summers
- Disease management needs attention

## Food Preferences & Goals

### Primary Motivations
- [x] Fresh, flavorful produce
- [x] Food production for household and neighbors (volume/sharing focus)
- [x] Experimentation and learning

### Preservation Methods
- [ ] Canning - No
- [x] Freezing - Yes (some)
- [x] Dehydrating - Have dehydrator but haven't used recently
- [x] Fermentation - Yes (some)

### Cuisine Preferences
- **Favorite cuisines**: Asian, Mexican, Italian
- **Must-have crops**:
  - Tomatoes (top priority)
  - Peppers (proven success)
  - Peas and beans (want to add)
  - Herbs for Asian/Mexican/Italian cooking
- **Crops to avoid**: None specifically identified
- **Sharing focus**: High-volume crops suitable for sharing with neighbors

## Budget Considerations

### Annual Garden Budget
- **Approximate budget**: $500/year baseline, willing to spend more if needed
- **Priorities for spending**:
  - Soil amendments (beds need amendment)
  - Seeds/transplants
  - Soaker hose irrigation setup
  - Compost (will need to purchase)
- **Cost-saving strategies**:
  - Chicken manure as free fertilizer
  - Black soldier fly larvae composting (small scale)

## Notes & Observations
- Current sun exposure (5-6 hours) is workable but not ideal - need to select varieties accordingly
- Extreme summer heat in Durham is a significant factor - heat-tolerant varieties essential
- Chain link fence offers opportunity for vertical growing
- Large herb collection suggests strong success with herbs in current conditions
- Focus on volume production for sharing means succession planting and high-yield varieties important
