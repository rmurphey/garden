  - Location: Backyard at 3301 Courtland Drive
  - Sun exposure: 5-6 hours per day at peak summer
  - Soil mix: Topsoil with some compost (needs amendment)

**Total raised bed space**: ~79 sq ft

### Containers
- **Quantity**: 10-20 containers, most around 1 cubic foot in size
- **Location**: Backyard, various locations
- **Sun exposure**: 5-6 hours at peak summer, some slightly less, some slightly more
- **Notes**: Well-aerated containers performed better for sweet potatoes than less-aerated ones

### Other Growing Spaces
- **3-foot chain link fence**: Largely but not entirely shaded, could support climbing plants

## Infrastructure & Resources

### Water Access
- **Current setup**: Mix of sprinkler and hand-watering with hose
- **Planned**: Would like to set up soaker hoses
- **Water availability**: Standard residential access

### Livestock
- **Chickens**: 9 chickens on site
- **Benefits**: Chicken manure available for garden use; black soldier fly larvae from compost fed to chickens

### Composting
- **Setup**: Tray system that grows black soldier fly larvae (fed to chickens)
- **Output**: Does not produce much finished compost
- **Plan**: Will need to buy compost for amendments

## Time & Maintenance

### Available Time
- **Weekly time available**: ~10 hours per week during growing season
- **Peak busy seasons**: TBD

### Physical Considerations
- None noted

## Growing Experience

### Seasons Completed
- **At this location**: Nearly one full season completed
- **Previous experience**: TBD

### Past Successes
**Peppers** (excellent performers):
- Purple bell peppers
- Banana peppers
- Jalapeños
- Poblanos

**Other vegetables**:
- Tomatillos (grew well)
- Sweet potatoes (moderate success - better in well-aerated containers)

**Herbs** (grew very well):
- Basil
- Cilantro
- Parsley
- Marjoram
- Thyme
- Rosemary
- Thai basil
- Bee balm
- Lemon verbena
- Lemongrass

**Flowers**:
- Marigolds (thrived, still alive)

### Past Challenges
**Crops that struggled**:
- Melons (failure to produce)
- Berries (failure to produce)
- Squash (failure to produce)
- Cucumbers (failure to produce)

**Root causes identified**:
1. **HUMID HEAT STRESS** (primary cause)
   - Planted May/June when heat index already >100°F
   - Pollination failed during July's heat index >100-105°F period
   - Durham's 70-80% humidity prevents plant transpiration cooling
   - Likely used California-bred "heat-tolerant" varieties (bred for dry heat, fail in humidity)

2. **Late start to season**
   - Should transplant mid-April, not late May
   - Plants need to establish and set fruit before July's humid heat stress

3. **Disease pressure amplified by humidity**
   - Powdery mildew, downy mildew thrive in 75-80% humidity
   - Squash vine borer (common in Southeast)

### Lessons Learned
- **Durham's #1 challenge is HUMID HEAT, not just high temperatures**
  - Heat index (temp + humidity) matters more than air temp
  - Must use Southern humid-heat-tolerant varieties, NOT California "heat-tolerant" varieties
- Well-aerated containers are important for root crops like sweet potatoes
- Sun exposure (5-6 hours) is adequate for peppers, tomatillos, and herbs
- Must start 6+ weeks earlier (mid-April transplants, not late May)
- Expect 3-4 week production gap mid-July to early-August when heat index >100°F
- Disease management critical in humid climate

## Food Preferences & Goals

### Primary Motivations
- [x] Fresh, flavorful produce
- [x] Food production for household and neighbors (volume/sharing focus)
- [x] Experimentation and learning

### Preservation Methods
- [ ] Canning - No
- [x] Freezing - Yes (some)
- [x] Dehydrating - Have dehydrator but haven't used recently
- [x] Fermentation - Yes (some)

### Cuisine Preferences
- **Favorite cuisines**: Asian, Mexican, Italian
- **Must-have crops**:
  - Tomatoes (top priority)
  - Peppers (proven success)
  - Peas and beans (want to add)
  - Herbs for Asian/Mexican/Italian cooking
- **Crops to avoid**: None specifically identified
- **Sharing focus**: High-volume crops suitable for sharing with neighbors

## Budget Considerations

### Annual Garden Budget
- **Approximate budget**: $500/year baseline, willing to spend more if needed
- **Priorities for spending**:
  - Soil amendments (beds need amendment)
  - Seeds/transplants
  - Soaker hose irrigation setup
  - Compost (will need to purchase)
- **Cost-saving strategies**:
  - Chicken manure as free fertilizer
  - Black soldier fly larvae composting (small scale)

## Notes & Observations
- Current sun exposure (5-6 hours) is workable but not ideal - need to select varieties accordingly
- **HUMID HEAT STRESS is Durham's critical challenge**:
  - Heat index regularly hits 100-110°F even when air temp is only 90-95°F
  - Durham's 70-80% humidity prevents plant cooling via transpiration
  - Must use varieties bred for Southern humid heat (Arkansas, Louisiana, Southeast)
  - Avoid California-bred varieties - they fail in humidity despite "heat-tolerant" label
  - Expect pollination failure mid-July to early-August during peak heat index >100°F
- Chain link fence offers opportunity for vertical growing
- Large herb collection suggests strong success with herbs in current conditions
- Focus on volume production for sharing means succession planting and high-yield varieties important
