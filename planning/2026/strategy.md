# 2026 Garden Strategy - Durham, NC (Zone 7b/8a)

**Location**: Durham, NC 27707
**Growing Season**: Mid-April (last frost) to Mid-November (first frost) = 7 months
**Key Challenge**: **HUMID HEAT STRESS** - Heat index 100-110°F in July/August (even when air temp is only 90-95°F)
  - Durham's 70-80% humidity prevents plant transpiration cooling
  - Pollination fails in tomatoes/peppers when heat index >100-105°F
  - Expect 3-4 week production gap during peak humid heat (mid-July to early-August)
**Secondary Challenge**: 5-6 hours sun (partial shade)
**Focus**: High-volume production for household + neighbors, Asian/Mexican/Italian cuisines

---

## Executive Summary: 2026 Success Strategy

**What's different from 2025:**
1. **EARLY START**: Seeds indoors by late February, transplants by mid-April (not late May)
   - **WHY**: Fruit set before July's humid heat stress (heat index >100°F)
2. **HUMID-HEAT-TOLERANT VARIETIES**: Southern-bred cultivars, NOT California "heat-tolerant" varieties
   - **WHY**: California varieties bred for dry heat fail in Durham's 75-80% humidity
   - Arkansas Traveler tomatoes, Costata Romanesco squash, Southern heirlooms
3. **SUCCESSION PLANTING**: Continuous harvest of tomatoes, cucumbers, squash, beans, lettuce
   - **WHY**: Backup when humid heat causes production gaps
4. **SOIL AMENDMENT**: Add 2-3" compost to all beds BEFORE planting (February/March)
5. **DISEASE PREVENTION**: Crop rotation, resistant varieties, proper spacing, early detection
   - **WHY**: 70-80% humidity amplifies fungal diseases
6. **VERTICAL GROWING**: Maximize fence space for peas, beans, cucumbers
7. **ACCEPT JULY PRODUCTION GAP**: Expect minimal fruit set mid-July to early-August when heat index >100°F

## Soil Amendment Plan

### Current Situation (2025 End)
- Beds: Topsoil + "some compost" (insufficient organic matter)
- Clay-heavy native Durham soil underneath
- Needs significant amendment for 2026 success

### Amendment Goal
- Add **2-3 inches of compost** to all raised beds (79 sq ft total)
- Work in **aged chicken manure** (nitrogen boost)
- Add compost to containers (full refresh for sweet potatoes)

---

### How Much Compost Needed?

**Raised Beds**:
- Total area: 79 sq ft
- Depth needed: 2.5 inches (average)
- Volume: 79 sq ft × 2.5 in = 79 × 0.208 ft = **16.4 cubic feet**
- Safety margin: Round to **18-20 cubic feet** (0.65-0.75 cubic yards)

**Containers** (assuming 15 containers, 1 cu ft each):
- Full refresh for sweet potato containers: 8 cu ft
- Top-dress other containers: 7 cu ft
- Total: **15 cubic feet** (0.55 cubic yards)

**TOTAL COMPOST NEEDED: 35 cu ft = ~1.3 cubic yards**

---

### Chicken Manure Strategy

**Current Resource**: 9 chickens on site = free nitrogen source

**HOW TO USE (Critical - fresh manure burns plants)**:

1. **Start Composting NOW (November 2025)**:
   - Collect chicken manure from coop
   - Layer in pile or bin: manure, brown leaves, manure, leaves
   - Keep moist, turn monthly
   - **Needs 3-6 months to age** (ready by March-April 2026)

2. **Application (March 2026)**:
   - Mix aged chicken manure into beds with compost
   - Ratio: 1 part aged manure to 4 parts compost
   - Amount: ~10-15 gallons aged manure total (spread across 79 sq ft)

3. **Throughout Season**:
   - Continue composting fresh manure
   - Use aged manure (6+ months old) as side-dress for heavy feeders:
     - Tomatoes (monthly)
     - Squash (every 3 weeks)
     - Cucumbers (every 3 weeks)

**Benefits**:
- Free nitrogen source
- Improves soil structure
- High in phosphorus (good for fruiting plants)

**Warning**:
- NEVER use fresh chicken manure directly on garden (too high in nitrogen, burns roots)
- Always age 3-6 months minimum

---

### Total Soil Amendment Budget (2026)

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Bulk compost (1.5 yards delivered) | $115-120 |
| Chicken manure (free, you have chickens) | $0 |
| Organic fertilizer for containers (slow-release) | $25-30 |
| **TOTAL** | **$140-150** |

**Remaining from $500 budget**: $350-360 for seeds, transplants, irrigation

## Strategy for 2025 Failures: Cucumbers & Summer Squash

### Why They Failed in 2025

**Primary Issues**:
1. **Late start** - Transplanted May/June when heat index already >100°F
2. **HUMID HEAT STRESS** - Varieties not bred for Southern humid heat (likely California-bred)
   - Pollination failed during July heat index >100-105°F periods
   - Plants couldn't transpire-cool in 75-80% humidity
3. **Disease pressure** - Powdery mildew, downy mildew amplified by high humidity
4. **Squash vine borer** - Common in Southeast
5. **Possible poor soil** - Needed more organic matter

---

### 2026 Success Plan for Cucumbers

**CHANGE 1: Humid-Heat-Tolerant Varieties**
- **'Poinsett 76'** - **Specifically bred for hot, humid Southeast** (not California)
- **'Marketmore 76'** - Proven humid heat tolerance, disease resistance
- **'Korean Long' / 'Suyo Long'** - Asian varieties handle humid heat well

**CHANGE 2: Early Start + Succession**
- First planting transplanted **mid-April** (not late May)
- **WHY**: Plants establish and set fruit before July's heat index >100°F period
- 3 successions = continuous harvest + backup if one fails during humid heat stress

**CHANGE 3: Disease Prevention**
- **Resistant varieties** ('Poinsett 76', 'Marketmore 76' have PM/DM resistance)
- **Spacing**: 2 ft apart minimum (air circulation prevents fungal diseases)
- **Vertical growing**: Fence/trellis keeps leaves dry, reduces soil contact
- **Weekly monitoring**: Check undersides of leaves for powdery mildew
- **Organic spray**: Neem oil or potassium bicarbonate at first sign of disease
- **Remove affected leaves** immediately

**CHANGE 4: Consistent Water + Mulch**
- Soaker hoses (install in March) - consistent moisture prevents stress
- 2-3" mulch around plants (straw or shredded leaves) - keeps roots cool, prevents disease splash

**CHANGE 5: Pick Daily**
- Leaving mature cucumbers on vine stops production
- Harvest every day during peak (June-July)
- Expected yield: 5-10 cucumbers per plant per week at peak

---

### 2026 Success Plan for Summer Squash

**CHANGE 1: Italian/Mediterranean Humid-Heat-Tolerant Varieties**
- **'Costata Romanesco'** - **Italian heirloom bred for Mediterranean humidity**, thrives in Durham heat
- **'Cocozelle'** - **Italian heirloom, very reliable in humid South**
- **'Magda'** - **Lebanese, extremely humid-heat tolerant**
- **Skip common varieties like 'Black Beauty'** - bred for temperate climates, disease-prone in Durham humidity

**CHANGE 2: Early Start + Succession**
- First planting transplanted **mid-April**
- Second planting late May (replaces first when it succumbs to borers/disease)
- Expect 4-8 weeks of production per planting

**CHANGE 3: Squash Vine Borer Prevention (MAJOR PEST in NC)**

**Identification**:
- Adult: Red/black wasp-like moth (flies during day, May-July)
- Larvae: White caterpillar bores into stem base
- Damage: Sudden wilting, sawdust-like frass at stem base

**Prevention Strategy**:
1. **Row covers** over young plants (remove when flowering starts for pollination)
2. **Aluminum foil wrap** around stem base (2-3" up from soil) - prevents egg-laying
3. **Plant succession** - when first planting gets hit (will happen), second is ready
4. **Monitor weekly** - check stem bases for holes/frass
5. **Hand-pick eggs** - check undersides of leaves in May/June, crush orange eggs

**If Borer Gets In**:
- Slit stem lengthwise with knife
- Remove caterpillar
- Bury damaged stem section under soil (may re-root)

**CHANGE 4: Powdery Mildew Management**

**Prevention**:
- Resistant varieties ('Costata Romanesco' has some resistance)
- 3 ft spacing minimum
- Water at base (not overhead)
- Weekly neem oil spray preventatively (starts in May)

**Treatment** (if it appears):
- Baking soda spray: 1 tbsp baking soda + 1 tbsp vegetable oil + 1 gallon water
- Spray weekly until controlled

**CHANGE 5: Pick VERY Young**
- Squash is best at 4-6" long (not 10-12")
- Picking young = more production, better flavor, less borer time to mature
- Check plants DAILY during peak production

---

### Why This Will Work in 2026

**Timing**:
- 2025: Late May/June start = instant heat stress
- 2026: Mid-April start = 6 weeks establishment before extreme heat

**Varieties**:
- 2025: Unknown (possibly generic varieties)
- 2026: Heat-tolerant, disease-resistant, Southern-adapted varieties

**Prevention**:
- 2025: Reactive
- 2026: Proactive (row covers, monitoring, resistant varieties, succession planting)

**Soil**:
- 2025: Insufficient organic matter
- 2026: 2-3" compost amendment = better water retention, healthier plants = disease resistance

**Backup Plan**:
- 2025: Single planting
- 2026: Succession plantings = if one fails, others continue

---

## Vertical Growing Plan (Chain Link Fence)

### Fence Assessment
- **Height**: 3 ft (typical residential chain link)
- **Length**: Estimate 12-20 linear feet (confirm actual)
- **Sun exposure**: "Largely but not entirely shaded" - partial shade
- **Structure**: Sturdy enough for lightweight climbers (peas, beans, cucumbers)

---

### What Grows Well on Fence (Partial Shade OK)

**PEAS** (spring + fall):
- Tolerate partial shade well
- Naturally climb with tendrils
- 40 plants spring, 40 plants fall

**POLE BEANS** (summer):
- Tolerate partial shade (may reduce yield slightly)
- Twine around fence or trellis wires
- 20 plants (Kentucky Wonder, Blue Lake)

**ASIAN LONG BEANS** (summer):
- LOVE heat, tolerate partial shade
- Very vigorous climbers
- 10 plants (Red Noodle)

**CUCUMBERS** (summer):
- Partial shade OK (especially in Durham heat - may actually help)
- Need manual training (don't climb automatically)
- 8-12 plants (succession 1 & 2)

---

### Installation & Training (March 2026)

**STEP 1: Add Horizontal Support** (if needed)
- Chain link alone may be adequate
- Optional: Run heavy twine or wire horizontally at 1 ft, 2 ft, 3 ft heights
- Creates more attachment points for vines

**STEP 2: Soil Prep at Fence Base**
- Amend soil along fence line (add compost)
- 6-8" deep, 12" wide strip
- Install soaker hose if extending irrigation to fence area

**STEP 3: Planting Layout** (assume 15 linear feet of fence)

```
SPRING (March-June):
[---------------------------------------- 15 feet ----------------------------------------]
| SUGAR SNAP PEAS (20 plants, 8-9" apart) | CASCADIA PEAS (20 plants, 8-9" apart) |

(Peas planted early March, harvest May-June, remove by late June when too hot)

SUMMER (May-September):
[---------------------------------------- 15 feet ----------------------------------------]
| CUCUMBERS (8 plants, 2 ft apart, 8 ft total) | POLE BEANS (15 plants, 6" apart, 7.5 ft) |

or

[---------------------------------------- 15 feet ----------------------------------------]
| CUCUMBERS (6 plants) | KENTUCKY WONDER BEANS (10 plants) | ASIAN LONG BEANS (10 plants) |

FALL (August-November):
[---------------------------------------- 15 feet ----------------------------------------]
| SNOW PEAS / SUGAR SNAP (40 plants, 4-5" apart) for fall harvest |
```

**STEP 4: Training Techniques**

**Peas**:
- No training needed (climb automatically)
- Plant 1" deep, 4-6" apart
- Germination: 7-14 days

**Pole Beans**:
- Train young plants to twine around fence
- Gently wrap counterclockwise (natural growth direction)
- Once established, climb on their own

**Cucumbers**:
- Manually weave vines through fence horizontally
- Tie with soft twine if needed (don't let weight pull vines down)
- Check every 3-4 days, redirect new growth

---

### Maintenance Schedule (Fence Crops)

**March**:
- Plant peas, install any additional support

**April-May**:
- Harvest peas regularly (daily when producing)
- Monitor for aphids (spray with water if present)

**Late May**:
- Plant pole beans, cucumbers at fence base
- Remove pea plants (pull or cut at soil level)

**June-August**:
- Train cucumber/bean vines weekly
- Harvest beans every 2-3 days
- Harvest cucumbers daily
- Monitor for cucumber beetles (hand-pick or spray neem)

**Late August**:
- Remove spent cucumber/bean vines
- Plant fall peas

**September-November**:
- Harvest fall peas
- Less aphid pressure in fall (usually)

---

## Quantities to Plant (Based on Space & Sharing Goals)

### Expected Yields (Per Week at Peak Production)

| Crop | Plants | Weekly Yield (Peak) | Season Length | Total Harvest |
|------|--------|---------------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Tomatoes (slicing)** | 11 | 20-30 lbs | 16 weeks (Jun-Sep) | 320-480 lbs |
| **Tomatoes (cherry)** | 12 | 15-25 lbs | 18 weeks (Jun-Oct) | 270-450 lbs |
| **Cucumbers** | 17 | 50-100 | 8 weeks (Jun-Aug) | 400-800 cucumbers |
| **Summer Squash** | 12 | 20-40 | 6 weeks (Jun-Aug) | 120-240 squash |
| **Peppers** | 16 | 8-15 lbs | 20 weeks (Jun-Oct) | 160-300 lbs |
| **Beans (bush)** | 80 | 5-8 lbs | 2-3 weeks each succession | 40-64 lbs |
| **Peas** | 80 | 3-5 lbs | 4 weeks each season | 24-40 lbs |
| **Basil** | 90+ | 2-4 lbs | All season | 60-100 lbs |

---

### Is This Enough for Household + Sharing?

**Household Size**: Assume 2-4 people

**Fresh Eating + Sharing**:
- **Tomatoes**: 600-900 lbs total = 20-30 lbs/week average (plenty for fresh eating, sauce, sharing)
- **Cucumbers**: 50-100/week at peak = household uses 10-20, share 40-80/week
- **Squash**: 20-40/week at peak = household uses 5-10, share 15-30/week
- **Peppers**: 8-15 lbs/week = household uses 3-5 lbs, share 5-10 lbs
- **Herbs**: Massive surplus for sharing (basil especially)

**Verdict**: This plan produces HIGH VOLUME suitable for sharing with multiple neighbors

**Peak Sharing Weeks (July)**:
- 50+ cucumbers
- 20+ squash
- 20 lbs tomatoes
- 10 lbs peppers
- 5 lbs beans
- 2 lbs basil

**Total**: 100+ lbs of produce per week at peak (50% for sharing)

---

## Disease & Pest Management Plan

### Top 5 Threats in Durham Gardens

1. **Powdery Mildew** (cucumbers, squash, tomatoes)
2. **Squash Vine Borer** (squash, pumpkins)
3. **Tomato Hornworm** (tomatoes, peppers)
4. **Cucumber Beetle** (cucumbers, squash)
5. **Aphids** (all crops, especially peas)

---

### Preventative Strategies

**BEFORE PLANTING** (March):
1. **Crop Rotation**: Don't plant tomatoes/peppers in same bed 2 years in a row (2027 rotation)
2. **Soil Health**: Compost amendment = strong plants = disease resistance
3. **Resistant Varieties**: See variety recommendations above
4. **Spacing**: Follow spacing recommendations (air circulation prevents fungal diseases)

**DURING SEASON**:
1. **Weekly Scouting** (15 min/week):
   - Check undersides of leaves (aphids, eggs, early disease)
   - Look for wilting, yellowing, spots
   - Check stem bases for borer frass
2. **Companion Planting**:
   - Marigolds throughout garden (repel aphids, beetles)
   - Basil near tomatoes/peppers (repel aphids, flies)
3. **Mulch**: 2-3" straw/shredded leaves (prevents disease splash from soil)
4. **Water Management**: Soaker hoses at base (not overhead) - dry leaves resist fungal diseases

---

### Organic Treatment Protocols

**Powdery Mildew** (white powder on leaves):
- **Prevention**: Weekly neem oil spray (starts May)
- **Treatment**: Baking soda spray (1 tbsp baking soda + 1 tbsp vegetable oil + 1 gallon water)
- **Removal**: Remove heavily infected leaves

**Squash Vine Borer** (sudden wilting, sawdust at stem base):
- **Prevention**: Aluminum foil around stem base, row covers until flowering
- **Monitoring**: Check for orange eggs on undersides of leaves (May-July), crush immediately
- **Treatment**: Slit stem, remove caterpillar, bury stem section to re-root
- **Acceptance**: Succession planting = expect to lose first crop, second crop succeeds

**Tomato Hornworm** (large green caterpillar, defoliation):
- **Monitoring**: Check plants weekly for droppings (looks like mouse poop)
- **Removal**: Hand-pick (they're huge, easy to see)
- **Biological**: If hornworm has white cocoons on back, leave it (parasitic wasp eggs - beneficial)

**Cucumber Beetle** (yellow/black striped or spotted beetle):
- **Prevention**: Row covers until flowering
- **Monitoring**: Check flowers and young fruit
- **Removal**: Hand-pick in morning (they're slow when cool)
- **Spray**: Neem oil if infestation is severe

**Aphids** (tiny green/black insects on new growth):
- **Prevention**: Marigolds, beneficial insects
- **Treatment**: Spray off with water (literally just hose them off)
- **Spray**: Insecticidal soap if severe

---

### Organic Spray Schedule

**NEEM OIL** (broad-spectrum preventative):
- **Mix**: 2 tbsp neem oil + 1 tsp dish soap + 1 gallon water
- **Schedule**: Every 7-10 days, May-August
- **Targets**: Powdery mildew, aphids, beetles, early blight
- **Application**: Spray in evening (neem can burn leaves in direct sun)

**BAKING SODA SPRAY** (fungal diseases):
- **Mix**: 1 tbsp baking soda + 1 tbsp vegetable oil + 1 gallon water
- **Use**: At first sign of powdery mildew
- **Application**: Weekly until controlled

**INSECTICIDAL SOAP** (soft-bodied insects):
- **Buy**: Pre-mixed (Safer Brand) or make your own (5 tbsp pure castile soap per gallon)
- **Use**: For aphids, whiteflies, spider mites
- **Application**: Spray undersides of leaves, repeat every 3-4 days

---

### Monthly Disease Monitoring Checklist

**APRIL-MAY**:
- [ ] Check peas for aphids (spray with water if present)
- [ ] Scout for cucumber beetle eggs on squash/cucumber leaves
- [ ] Install squash vine borer prevention (foil wraps, row covers)

**JUNE-JULY** (peak disease pressure):
- [ ] Weekly powdery mildew checks (cucumbers, squash, tomatoes)
- [ ] Check squash stems for borer frass every 3-4 days
- [ ] Scout for tomato hornworms (look for droppings)
- [ ] Monitor for early blight on tomatoes (brown spots with concentric rings)

**AUGUST-SEPTEMBER**:
- [ ] Continue powdery mildew monitoring (often worse in fall)
- [ ] Remove heavily diseased plants (cucumber, squash) to make room for fall crops
- [ ] Reduce watering as temps cool (prevents fungal diseases)

---

## Irrigation & Water Management

### Current Setup (2025)
- Mix of sprinkler and hand-watering with hose
- Time-consuming, inconsistent moisture
- Overhead watering = increased disease risk

### 2026 Plan: Soaker Hose System

**WHY SOAKER HOSES**:
- Consistent moisture = less stress = better disease resistance
- Water at soil level = dry leaves = less fungal disease
- Time-saving (10 hours/week maintenance reduced by 2-3 hours)
- Cost-effective

---

### Soaker Hose Installation (March 2026)

**WHAT TO BUY**:

| Item | Quantity | Cost | Source |
|------|----------|------|--------|
| Soaker hose (50 ft) | 2 rolls | $40 ($20 each) | Lowe's, Home Depot |
| Hose splitter (4-way) | 1 | $15 | Lowe's, Home Depot |
| Hose timer (optional but recommended) | 1 | $30-40 | Lowe's, Home Depot |
| Hose stakes/pins | 20 | $8 | Lowe's, Home Depot |
| **TOTAL** | | **$93-103** | |

**Layout**:
- **Bed 1** (3x12): One 30 ft soaker hose down center, loops back
- **Bed 2** (3x9): One 25 ft soaker hose down center, loops back
- **Bed 3** (16 sq ft): One 15 ft soaker hose, zigzag pattern
- **Fence area**: One 15 ft soaker hose along base

**Installation Steps**:
1. Connect 4-way splitter to outdoor spigot
2. Run regular hose from splitter to each bed
3. Connect soaker hose at bed entrance
4. Lay soaker hose 2-3" from plant stems (not touching)
5. Pin/stake in place
6. Cover with 1-2" mulch (protects hose, reduces evaporation)
7. Test system (should weep slowly, not spray)

**Timer Settings** (if using):
- **Spring (April-May)**: 45 min, every other day (6 AM)
- **Summer (June-August)**: 60 min, daily (6 AM)
- **Fall (September-October)**: 45 min, every other day (6 AM)
- Adjust based on rainfall (turn off if rain expected)

---

### Watering Schedule (Manual or Timer)

**General Rule**: 1-1.5 inches of water per week (including rain)

**By Crop Type**:

| Crop | Water Needs | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Tomatoes | 1-2" per week, consistent | Inconsistent = blossom end rot, cracking |
| Cucumbers | 1-2" per week, regular | Love water, wilt easily |
| Squash | 1" per week, consistent | Deep watering = better roots |
| Peppers | 1" per week | Too much = slow growth, too little = small fruit |
| Beans | 1" per week, more when flowering | Critical during pod set |
| Peas | 1" per week | Don't overwater (root rot) |
| Greens | 1" per week, frequent | Shallow roots, need consistent moisture |

**Mulching** (Critical in Durham heat):
- Apply 2-3" straw, shredded leaves, or grass clippings around plants
- Reduces evaporation by 50%
- Keeps roots cool
- Prevents disease splash

---

### Container Watering

**Containers dry out MUCH faster** (especially in Durham summer heat):

**Schedule**:
- **Spring/Fall**: Every other day
- **Summer**: DAILY (possibly twice daily for small containers)

**Method**:
- Water until it drains from bottom
- Check soil moisture 2" deep (finger test)
- Consider self-watering containers for herbs (less maintenance)

**Tip**:
- Group containers by water needs (tomatoes together, herbs together)
- Add mulch to container surface (reduces evaporation)

---

## Keys to Success in 2026

**The Big 5 Changes**:
1. **START EARLY**: Seeds indoors by late February, transplants mid-April (not late May)
2. **HEAT-TOLERANT VARIETIES**: Arkansas Traveler tomatoes, Poinsett 76 cucumbers, Costata Romanesco squash
3. **SUCCESSION PLANTING**: Continuous harvest, backup if crops fail
4. **SOIL AMENDMENT**: 2-3" compost to all beds (March) - healthy soil = healthy plants
5. **DISEASE PREVENTION**: Resistant varieties, monitoring, neem spray, proper spacing

**What Makes This Plan Realistic**:
- Builds on 2025 successes (peppers, herbs, tomatillos)
- Fits your 10 hours/week time budget
- Uses your resources (chickens, containers, fence)
- Aligns with cuisine preferences (Asian, Mexican, Italian)
- Focuses on proven Durham varieties
- Includes backup plans (succession planting)
- Designed for high volume + sharing

## Questions to Consider Before 2026

**Review in December 2025**:
1. Is the fence actually suitable for vertical growing? (Check sturdiness, sun exposure)
2. Do you want to try any other crops not listed? (Sweet corn, onions, garlic, etc.)
3. Is 20 tomato plants too many/too few? (Adjust based on freezer space, preservation plans)
4. What did neighbors specifically request for 2026?
5. Any dietary changes that affect crop choices?
6. Budget confirmed at $500, or willing to spend more?

## Final Thoughts

This 2026 plan is **ambitious but achievable** with your space and time. You're going from nearly one full season of experience to a highly productive, well-planned second year.

**The learning curve is over** - you know your space, your successes (peppers, herbs), and your challenges (late start, heat stress, disease).

**This plan addresses every 2025 failure**:
- Late start → Early start (mid-April, not late May)
- Failed cucurbits → Heat-tolerant varieties, succession planting, disease prevention
- Unknown varieties → Specific Durham-proven cultivars
- Inconsistent watering → Soaker hoses
- Low volume → High-volume planting, succession crops

**You have everything you need**:
- Great space (79 sq ft + containers + fence)
- Adequate time (10 hours/week)
- Resources (chickens, compost, budget)
- Right climate zone (7b/8a = long season)
- Strong track record (peppers, herbs thrived)

**The 2026 season will teach you**:
- Which varieties YOU love (everyone's different)
- What your neighbors want most (adjust 2027 accordingly)
- How much is "enough" (20 tomatoes too many? Not enough?)
- What preservation methods work for your family

**This is a living document** - adjust as you go, take notes, and build your 2027 plan from this year's experience.

You're going to have an amazing 2026 garden season. Let's grow!
