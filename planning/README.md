## Planning for Future Years

When planning for 2027 and beyond:

1. **Create new year folder**: `planning/2027/`
2. **Copy template from 2026**: Use 2026 strategy as starting point
3. **Review previous year's diary**: Look at `diary/` entries for lessons learned
4. **Update varieties**: Based on performance and climate changes
5. **Adjust timing**: Adapt to frost date shifts and weather patterns
