# Garden Experiments

This directory is for tracking structured experiments in the garden.

## Why Track Experiments?

Documenting experiments helps you:
- Learn what works in Durham's specific climate
- Compare varieties and techniques systematically
- Build knowledge for future seasons
- Make data-driven decisions

## Experiment Template

Create a new file for each experiment using this structure:

```markdown
# Experiment: [Name]

**Date Started:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Duration:** [Expected timeframe]
**Status:** Planning | In Progress | Completed

## Hypothesis

What do you think will happen and why?

## Setup

### Control Group
- What are you comparing against?
- Location, varieties, conditions

### Test Group
- What are you testing?
- Location, varieties, conditions

### Variables
- What's different between control and test?
- What's kept the same?

## Observations

### YYYY-MM-DD
- What did you observe?
- Photos/diary references

### YYYY-MM-DD
- Continued observations...

## Results

### Quantitative
- Measurable outcomes (yield, size, quantity)

### Qualitative
- Health, taste, ease of growing

## Conclusions

- What did you learn?
- Would you do this again?
- Changes for next time?

## Example Experiments

Ideas for experiments to try:

### Variety Comparisons
- **Humid-heat tolerance**: Southern vs California tomato varieties
- **Disease resistance**: Different cucumber varieties vs downy mildew
- **Productivity**: Early vs main-season crops

### Growing Techniques
- **Companion planting**: Marigolds for pest control
- **Mulching**: Pine straw vs straw vs no mulch
- **Succession planting**: Timing for continuous harvest
- **Container vs raised bed**: Same variety, different locations

### Climate Adaptation
- **Shade cloth**: With vs without during peak summer
- **Watering frequency**: Daily vs every other day
- **Planting dates**: Early vs traditional timing for fall crops

### Soil & Fertility
- **Amendments**: Chicken manure vs compost vs store-bought
- **Cover crops**: Winter rye vs crimson clover
- **Fertilizer timing**: Weekly light vs monthly heavy

### Pest Management
- **Organic treatments**: Neem vs soap vs BT
- **Row covers**: Covered vs uncovered
- **Trap cropping**: Sacrificial plants vs none

## Tracking Tips

1. **Start simple**: One variable at a time
2. **Use diary system**: Record observations via video diary
3. **Be consistent**: Same measurement method throughout
4. **Document setup**: Take photos/video of initial conditions
5. **Weather context**: Note unusual weather that might affect results
6. **Multiple trials**: One season isn't definitive, try again

## Current Experiments

### [Strawberry Viability in Durham Humid Heat](strawberry-viability-2026.md)
**Status:** Planning
**Started:** March 2026 (planned)
**Duration:** 15 months (through June 2027)

Testing whether strawberries can successfully produce in Durham's humid heat climate by comparing:
- Day-neutral varieties (Seascape, Albion) vs everbearing (Quinault) vs June-bearing (Chandler)
- Container growing vs raised bed growing
- Heat tolerance and summer survival through heat index >100°F periods

**Key Question:** Can day-neutral strawberries provide viable yields by fruiting spring + fall while surviving July-August humid heat stress?

### [Shade Cloth for Humid Heat Stress Mitigation](2026-shade-cloth-heat-mitigation.md)
**Status:** Planning
**Started:** June 2026 (planned)
**Duration:** 8 weeks (mid-June through mid-August peak heat period)

Testing whether 30-40% shade cloth reduces blossom drop and increases fruit set in tomatoes and peppers during Durham's peak humid heat stress period (heat index >100°F). Comparing 3 Cherokee Purple tomato plants and 4 pepper plants (Purple Bell, Jalapeño) under shade cloth vs identical full-sun controls.

**Key Question:** Does shade cloth effectively mitigate Durham's humid heat stress to maintain pollination and fruit production during July-August heat index >100°F periods?

**Budget:** $40-75 for materials (shade cloth, PVC frame, clips)
