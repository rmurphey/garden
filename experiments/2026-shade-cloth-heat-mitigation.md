# Experiment: Shade Cloth for Humid Heat Stress Mitigation in Tomatoes and Peppers

**Date Started:** 2026-06-15 (planned)
**Duration:** 8 weeks (mid-June through mid-August peak heat period)
**Status:** Planning

## Hypothesis

Providing 30-40% shade cloth during Durham's peak humid heat stress period (heat index >100°F in July-August) will significantly reduce blossom drop and increase fruit set in tomatoes and peppers compared to full sun controls, resulting in measurably higher yields during and immediately following the heat stress period.

**Reasoning:** Durham's humid heat (75-80% humidity + 90-95°F air temperature = heat index 100-110°F) prevents plant transpiration cooling and causes reproductive failure in solanaceous crops. Shade cloth should reduce leaf temperature by 10-15°F, allowing continued pollination and fruit set during peak heat stress when full-sun plants experience production gaps.

## Setup

## Observation Protocol

### Installation (June 15, 2026)

**Shade Cloth Structure:**
- Material: 30% shade cloth (agriculture-grade knitted polyethylene)
- Dimensions: Two 6ft x 8ft pieces (one for tomatoes, one for peppers)
- Support: PVC pipe frame or T-posts with crossbar, 5-6 ft tall
- Placement: Shade cloth 12-18" above plant tops (allows air circulation, reduces heat buildup)
- Orientation: Provides shade during peak sun hours (11am-4pm), but allows morning/evening sun
- Secure with zip ties/clips (must withstand wind)

**Photo Documentation:**
- Take photos of installation setup
- Photo each plant before shade installation (establish baseline)
- Mark each plant with waterproof label (TC1, TC2, TC3, TS1, TS2, TS3, etc.)

### Weekly Observations (Every Sunday, 8am)

**Week 1-2 (June 15-28): Establishment & Baseline**
- Count existing flower clusters on all plants
- Count existing fruit set on all plants (baseline)
- Rate heat stress signs (1-5 scale)
- Record any blossom drop visible on ground
- Take photos of shade vs control plants

**Week 3-8 (July 1 - August 15): Peak Heat Stress Period**
- **Sunday morning (8am, before heat):**
  - Count new flower clusters appearing this week (all plants)
  - Count new fruit set (small green fruits appeared this week)
  - Measure/estimate blossom drop (count dropped flowers on ground if possible, or estimate % of clusters that failed to set)
  - Harvest all ripe fruit, weigh separately by plant ID, record
  - Rate heat stress signs (leaf curl, wilting, yellowing - scale 1-5)
  - Take weekly comparison photos (same angle, control vs shade)

- **Wednesday evening (6pm, during/after peak heat):**
  - Quick observation: note wilting severity in control vs shade plants
  - Note any extreme heat stress (record air temp + humidity if available)

**Week 9-10 (August 16-31): Recovery Period**
- Same Sunday protocol as weeks 3-8
- Assess whether control group recovers after heat stress period ends
- Continue harvest and yield tracking
- Note if shade cloth is removed (if heat stress period ends)

### Data Recording

**Use Garden Diary for Weekly Entries:**
- Reference this experiment in each weekly diary entry
- Include all quantitative measurements in a simple table format
- Add photos to diary/photos directory with dates
- Note weather context (particularly heat index readings)

**Maintain Simple Data Table** (in this document or spreadsheet):

```
Date | Plant ID | Flower Clusters | Fruit Set This Week | Blossom Drop % | Ripe Fruit Count | Ripe Fruit Weight (lbs) | Heat Stress Score (1-5) | Notes
```

### Success Metrics

**Primary Success Indicator:**
- Shade group shows >25% reduction in blossom drop rate during peak heat stress period (July 1-August 15) compared to control group

**Secondary Success Indicators:**
- Shade group produces >20% more fruit set during heat stress period
- Shade group yields >15% more total weight during experimental period
- Shade group shows lower heat stress scores (less wilting, leaf curl, yellowing)
- Shade group has fewer sunscald/quality issues

**Cost-Benefit Analysis:**
- Calculate yield increase (lbs) from shade group vs control
- Calculate cost of shade cloth materials (~$40-75)
- Determine if yield increase justifies investment and setup effort
- Consider qualitative factors (easier care, less plant stress, extended harvest window)

## Materials & Budget

## Recommendations

### For 2027 Garden

**Based on these results, for next year I will:**

1. **Shade Cloth Decision:**
   - [ ] Install shade cloth on ALL tomatoes and peppers (if strongly positive results)
   - [ ] Install shade cloth on tomatoes only / peppers only (if one crop benefited more)
   - [ ] Install shade cloth on increased sample size to confirm results (if moderately positive)
   - [ ] Skip shade cloth (if no benefit or negative results)
   - [ ] Modify approach: [different shade percentage, different timing, etc.]

2. **Experiment Refinement:**
   - [What would I change about the experimental design?]
   - [Larger sample size? Different varieties? Different shade %?]
   - [Better controls for ______?]

3. **Questions for Further Testing:**
   - [What new questions did this experiment raise?]
   - [Should I test different shade percentages (50% vs 30%)?]
   - [Should I test different installation timing (earlier in June vs mid-June)?]
   - [Should I test shade cloth on cucumbers/squash too?]

### Broader Implications

**What This Means for Durham Gardening:**
- [Did shade cloth effectively mitigate Durham's humid heat stress?]
- [Is this a technique worth recommending to other local gardeners?]
- [Are there better heat mitigation strategies to test instead?]

### Alternative Heat Mitigation Strategies to Consider

**If shade cloth wasn't effective or had drawbacks, consider testing:**
- Earlier planting (late March) to maximize fruit set before peak heat
- Heat-tolerant variety comparisons (Arkansas Traveler vs Cherokee Purple)
- Reflective mulch (white plastic mulch to reduce soil temperature)
- Increased watering frequency during heat stress
- Foliar spray cooling (misting during peak heat - though risky for disease)
- Accept production gap and focus on succession planting instead

**Experiment Design Notes:**

This experiment follows best practices for home garden trials:
- **Clear hypothesis** with specific, measurable outcomes
- **True control group** (identical except for one variable)
- **Adequate sample size** for home garden (3-4 plants per group, total 14 plants)
- **Replication** within treatment (not just one plant per treatment)
- **Controlled variables** (same genetics, timing, location, care)
- **Multiple metrics** (primary = blossom drop, secondary = yield, quality, plant health)
- **Practical focus** (cost-benefit analysis, ease of use, scalability)

**Why This Design Is Rigorous Yet Achievable:**
- Uses existing plants in 2026 plan (Cherokee Purple tomatoes, Purple Bell and Jalapeño peppers)
- Doesn't require additional space or plants beyond what's already planned
- Simple weekly observations (30-45 min per week)
- Clear success metrics (>25% blossom drop reduction = success)
- Affordable materials ($40-75 one-time investment, reusable)
- Fits into existing 10 hours/week garden maintenance schedule

**Confidence Level:**
With 3 tomato plants and 4 pepper plants per group (total n=14), this is a small but meaningful sample for home garden experimentation. If all shade plants outperform all control plants, that's strong evidence even with small n. If results are mixed (some shade plants better, some worse), we'll need to acknowledge low confidence and consider repeating with larger sample in 2027.

**Expected Outcome:**
Based on research and Durham climate patterns, shade cloth is likely to show positive results (reduced blossom drop, increased fruit set) during peak heat stress. However, there may be tradeoffs (slightly smaller fruit, slower ripening) that need to be weighed against benefits. This experiment will provide data to make an informed decision about scaling up shade cloth use in 2027.
