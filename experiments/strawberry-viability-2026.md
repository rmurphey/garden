# Experiment: Strawberry Viability in Durham Humid Heat

**Date Started:** 2026-03-01 (planned)
**Duration:** 15 months (March 2026 - June 2027, full season + overwinter)
**Status:** Planning

## Hypothesis

Strawberries can successfully produce viable yields in Durham, NC (27707) raised bed and container gardens **if** day-neutral or heat-tolerant everbearing varieties are selected and grown with afternoon shade during peak humid heat (July-August). I expect:

1. **Day-neutral varieties** will outperform June-bearing varieties by continuing production through summer humid heat
2. **Container-grown strawberries** with movable shade will outperform raised bed strawberries during heat index >100°F periods
3. **Total yield per plant** will be 0.5-1.5 lbs across full season (spring + fall peaks, minimal summer production)
4. **Plant survival** through Durham's humid heat will exceed 75% if proper variety selection and summer management (shade, water, mulch) are employed

**Reasoning**:
- Durham's climate challenge is **humid heat stress** (heat index >100°F for 15+ days in July), not cold winters
- Traditional June-bearing varieties fruit in May-June (before peak heat) but occupy space all summer without producing
- Day-neutral/everbearing varieties can fruit spring + fall while going semi-dormant in July heat
- Strawberries prefer cool conditions (60-80°F) but heat-tolerant varieties exist for Southern climates
- Container mobility allows for microclimate optimization (shade during extreme heat)

## Setup

### Test Group 1: Day-Neutral Varieties (Heat-Tolerant)
**Location:**
- Raised Bed 3 (section): 6 plants
- Large containers (12" depth, 12" diameter): 6 plants
- **Total: 12 plants**

**Varieties:**
- **'Seascape'** (6 plants: 3 bed, 3 container) - Day-neutral, bred for warm climates, fruit spring-fall
- **'Albion'** (6 plants: 3 bed, 3 container) - Day-neutral, heat-tolerant, excellent flavor, disease-resistant

**Planting Details:**
- Planting date: Early March 2026 (bare-root crowns or transplants)
- Spacing: 12" apart in raised bed (triangle pattern)
- Containers: One plant per 12" pot
- Soil: Amended with compost (pH 5.8-6.5), well-draining
- Mulch: 2" pine straw (keeps roots cool, conserves moisture)

### Test Group 2: Everbearing Variety (Southern-Adapted)
**Location:**
- Raised Bed 3 (section): 3 plants
- Large containers (12" depth, 12" diameter): 3 plants
- **Total: 6 plants**

**Variety:**
- **'Quinault'** - Everbearing, tolerates heat better than most, large fruit, spring + fall crops

**Planting Details:**
- Same as Test Group 1 (early March 2026, 12" spacing, pine straw mulch)

### Control Group: June-Bearing Variety (Traditional)
**Location:**
- Raised Bed 3 (section): 3 plants
- Large containers: 3 plants
- **Total: 6 plants**

**Variety:**
- **'Chandler'** or **'Earliglow'** - Classic June-bearing, fruits heavily May-June then dormant

**Planting Details:**
- Same planting protocol as test groups
- Purpose: Compare productivity of traditional approach (heavy spring crop, no summer/fall fruit) vs. day-neutral extended season

### Controlled Variables
**Kept constant across all groups:**
- Planting date (early March 2026)
- Soil preparation (compost amendment, pH adjusted to 5.8-6.5)
- Container size (12" diameter, 12" depth minimum for container plants)
- Mulch type and depth (2" pine straw)
- Irrigation frequency (daily in summer heat, every other day in spring/fall)
- Fertilization schedule (monthly liquid organic fertilizer March-October)
- Pest management (same organic methods applied to all plants)
- Runner management (remove runners to focus energy on fruiting)

**Different between groups:**
- Variety type (day-neutral vs everbearing vs June-bearing)
- Location (raised bed vs container) - testing which is better for strawberries

### Measured Variables

**Quantitative (Data Table):**
1. **Yield**: Total fruit weight per plant (weekly harvest weighed)
2. **Fruit count**: Number of berries per plant per week
3. **Fruit size**: Average berry weight (calculate from total weight ÷ count)
4. **Plant survival**: How many plants alive at end of each season
5. **Heat stress days**: Days with heat index >100°F during observation period
6. **Runner production**: Number of runners produced (indicator of plant stress - more runners = less fruiting)

**Qualitative (Observations):**
1. **Flavor**: Taste test ratings (1-5 scale: excellent, good, acceptable, poor, inedible)
2. **Fruit quality**: Color, firmness, disease issues (gray mold, etc.)
3. **Plant health**: Visual appearance, leaf scorch, disease symptoms
4. **Flower production**: Abundant, moderate, sparse, none (by season)
5. **Ease of care**: Time required for maintenance (estimate hours/week)

**Seasonal Breakdown:**
- **Spring (March-May)**: Establishment and first fruiting period
- **Summer (June-August)**: Humid heat stress period, testing heat tolerance
- **Fall (September-November)**: Second fruiting period for day-neutral/everbearing
- **Winter (December-February)**: Dormancy, survival through mild Durham winter
- **Year 2 Spring (March-May 2027)**: Second-year production comparison

## Observation Protocol

### Weekly Tasks (March-November, during growing season)
**Every Sunday morning (cool part of day):**
1. **Harvest**: Pick all ripe berries, weigh total per variety/location
2. **Count**: Record number of berries harvested per plant
3. **Quality check**: Note flavor (taste 1-2 berries), firmness, disease issues
4. **Plant health**: Visually inspect leaves for scorch, disease, pests
5. **Flower count**: Estimate blooms present (none, few, moderate, abundant)
6. **Runner management**: Remove any runners, count before removing
7. **Weather notes**: Record week's high temp, heat index days >100°F, rainfall
8. **Photos**: Take photos of plants monthly (document appearance over time)

### Daily Tasks (Peak Heat: July-August)
1. **Watering**: Check soil moisture, water if dry 1" down (likely daily)
2. **Shade management (containers)**: Move to afternoon shade if heat index forecast >105°F
3. **Quick health check**: Look for wilting, leaf scorch

### Monthly Tasks
1. **Fertilization**: Apply diluted liquid organic fertilizer (fish emulsion or compost tea)
2. **Mulch check**: Replenish pine straw if thinned
3. **Data summary**: Calculate monthly totals (yield, fruit count, survival rate)

### Seasonal Management

**Spring Setup (March):**
- Plant bare-root crowns or transplants early March
- Ensure crown is at soil level (not buried)
- Water deeply at planting
- Apply 2" pine straw mulch around plants (keep away from crown)

**Summer Stress Management (June-August):**
- **For containers**: Move to location with afternoon shade during heat index >100°F days
- **For raised beds**: Consider temporary shade cloth (50%) over beds if heat index >105°F for 5+ consecutive days
- Increase watering to daily (strawberries have shallow roots)
- Monitor for leaf scorch (browning leaf edges = heat stress)
- Remove stressed/dead leaves
- **Expect**: Reduced flowering and fruiting during peak July heat - this is normal

**Fall Production (September-October):**
- Resume normal care as temps cool
- Watch for renewed flowering in day-neutral varieties
- Continue harvesting until first frost (mid-November)

**Winter (November-February):**
- Remove dead foliage after first frost
- **Optional**: Apply additional mulch (3-4" total) for winter protection
- No watering needed during dormancy (unless unusually dry)
- Document which varieties survived winter

**Year 2 Spring (March-May 2027):**
- Remove winter mulch as temps warm (early March)
- Resume fertilization and watering
- Compare second-year productivity to first year
- Document which varieties returned strongest

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Production (Experiment "Success")
- **Yield**: Average ≥0.5 lbs per plant across full season (15 months)
  - Equivalent to 1-2 pints per plant total
  - For 12 plants (day-neutral), = 6-12 lbs total (12-24 pints)
- **Plant survival**: ≥75% plants alive after humid heat stress (September count)
- **Fruit quality**: Average flavor rating ≥3/5 (acceptable or better)
- **Summer production**: Day-neutral varieties show ANY fruiting in September-October (proving they survived July heat)

### Optimal Production (Experiment "Highly Successful")
- **Yield**: Average ≥1.0 lb per plant across full season
- **Plant survival**: ≥90% survival through summer
- **Fruit quality**: Average flavor rating ≥4/5 (good to excellent)
- **Summer production**: Day-neutral varieties fruit 50%+ in fall compared to spring
- **Second year**: Plants return vigorous in Year 2 spring

### Variety Comparison Goals
- Identify which variety (Seascape, Albion, Quinault, or June-bearer) performs best in Durham conditions
- Determine if day-neutral advantage (extended season) outweighs potential lower per-berry quality
- Quantify yield difference between container vs raised bed growing

### Decision Metrics (End of Experiment)
**Question: "Should I grow strawberries in my Durham garden ongoing?"**

**YES, adopt strawberries if:**
- Any variety averages ≥0.75 lbs per plant (viable harvest for effort)
- Plant survival ≥75% (sustainable without constant replanting)
- Flavor acceptable (≥3/5 rating) - no point if they taste bad

**NO, skip strawberries if:**
- All varieties average <0.5 lbs per plant (not worth space/effort)
- Plant survival <50% (too much humid heat stress)
- Flavor poor (<3/5 rating)
- Excessive pest/disease issues require constant intervention

**REFINE and retry if:**
- Results marginal (0.5-0.75 lbs/plant) - try different varieties or management
- Container plants significantly outperform bed plants - shift all to containers
- One variety excels while others fail - focus on winner

## Durham-Specific Challenges to Monitor

### Humid Heat Stress (Primary Concern)
**Challenge**: Heat index >100°F for 15+ days in July causes:
- Reduced flowering/fruiting
- Leaf scorch and wilting
- Increased disease susceptibility
- Potential plant death

**What to Watch:**
- Do day-neutral varieties go dormant (stop flowering) during peak heat, then resume in fall?
- Does container mobility (moving to shade) reduce stress compared to stationary bed plants?
- Which variety shows least leaf scorch?

**Documentation:**
- Photograph leaf condition weekly during July-August
- Record exact days with heat index >100°F from weather data
- Note correlation between heat spikes and flower/fruit production drops

### Disease Pressure (Secondary Concern)
**Common strawberry diseases in humid climates:**
- **Gray mold (Botrytis)**: Fuzzy gray mold on fruit, especially after rain
- **Leaf spot**: Brown/purple spots on leaves
- **Powdery mildew**: White powder on leaves (less common on strawberries but possible)

**Prevention:**
- Good air circulation (12" spacing)
- Avoid overhead watering (drip or base watering)
- Remove diseased fruit/leaves immediately
- Pine straw mulch prevents soil splash

**What to Watch:**
- Does disease pressure spike after heavy rain events?
- Are container plants less affected (better drainage)?
- Do resistant varieties (Albion) show fewer issues?

### Pest Issues
**Potential Durham pests:**
- **Slugs**: Love strawberries, thrive in humidity
- **Birds**: Will eat ripe berries
- **Pill bugs**: May nibble fruit touching ground

**Management:**
- Hand-pick slugs in early morning
- Netting over plants if birds become issue
- Keep fruit off ground with mulch

### Winter Survival
**Durham mild winters should favor strawberries:**
- Average winter low: 32-34°F (strawberries hardy to 10-20°F)
- Few hard freezes below 20°F
- **Expectation**: Excellent survival, minimal winter damage

**What to Watch:**
- Do all plants return in spring, or do some varieties fail?
- Does container vs bed location affect winter survival?

| Item | Quantity | Cost per | Total |
|------|----------|----------|-------|
| Bare-root crowns or transplants | 24 plants | $3-5 each | $72-120 |
| Large containers (12") | 12 containers | $8-12 each | $96-144 |
| Potting soil for containers | 4 cu ft | $20 | $20 |
| Pine straw mulch (bale) | 1 bale | $6 | $6 |
| Organic fertilizer | 1 bottle | $12 | $12 |
| **TOTAL INITIAL** | | | **$206-302** |

### Ongoing Costs (15 months)

| Item | Frequency | Cost |
|------|-----------|------|
| Fertilizer refills | 2x | $24 |
| Mulch replenishment | 1x | $6 |
| Pest control (organic slug bait, netting) | As needed | $20 |
| **TOTAL ONGOING** | | **$50** |

**TOTAL EXPERIMENT COST: $256-352**

### Break-Even Analysis

**If experiment succeeds (1 lb/plant average across 24 plants = 24 lbs total):**
- Organic strawberries at farmers market: ~$6-8/lb
- Market value of harvest: $144-192
- **Cost recovery**: 50-75% in first 15 months

**If highly successful (1.5 lbs/plant = 36 lbs total):**
- Market value: $216-288
- **Cost recovery**: 85-110% (break-even or profit)

**Long-term (Year 2+):**
- Plants are perennials - years 2-3 only need fertilizer, mulch (~$30/year)
- If plants survive and produce 1 lb/plant in Year 2: $144-192 value vs $30 cost = highly cost-effective

**Conclusion**: Even moderate success makes strawberries cost-competitive with purchase, especially Year 2+

## Related Experiments (Future)

If strawberries succeed in this experiment, future refinements to test:

1. **Variety Expansion**: Test additional heat-tolerant varieties (e.g., 'Tribute', 'Tristar', 'Sweet Charlie')
2. **Shade Cloth Timing**: Test when to deploy shade (heat index >100°F vs >105°F threshold)
3. **Vertical Growing**: Test strawberry towers or hanging baskets for space efficiency
4. **Alpine Strawberries**: Test small-fruited alpine varieties (very heat-tolerant, different flavor profile)
5. **Soil pH Optimization**: Test yields at pH 5.8 vs 6.2 vs 6.5 (strawberries prefer acidic)
