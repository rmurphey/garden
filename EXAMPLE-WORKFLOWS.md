## Workflow 2: Detailed Weekend Inspection

**Scenario:** Saturday morning full garden walkthrough.

**Steps:**
1. Record 5-minute comprehensive video tour
2. Show each bed systematically
3. Close-ups of any problems
4. Film harvests laid out
5. Process video after lunch

**Example video narration:**
> "November 16th, Saturday morning full inspection.
>
> Starting with Bed 1 - tomatoes. Here's the Cherokee Purple [camera shows whole plant]. About 5 fruits ready. [Close-up] This one here is very ripe. [Shows lower leaves] See this yellowing pattern on the lower foliage? That's been progressing. [Shows tag] Cherokee Purple, planted April 15th.
>
> Moving to the Early Girl [pans to next plant]. This one has been more productive. [Shows fruits] Counting maybe 8-10 fruits at various stages. Harvested these three this morning [shows tomatoes on ground].
>
> Bed 2 - peppers. [Shows pepper plants] The purple bells are doing great. [Close-up of leaves] No aphids since the neem treatment Wednesday. [Shows pepper] This one's ready to pick.
>
> [Continues through all beds...]
>
> Here's everything I harvested today [shows layout of produce]. 3 tomatoes from Early Girl, 2 purple bell peppers, about a cup of basil.
>
> Plans: need to address that nitrogen issue on the Cherokee Purple, maybe side-dress with compost. Should start fall lettuce next week."

**AI generates:** Comprehensive entry with detailed observations per plant, growth tracking comparisons, harvest records, and problem diagnosis.

**Time investment:** 10-15 min total

## Workflow 3: Problem Documentation

**Scenario:** You notice aphids on peppers mid-week.

**Steps:**
1. Record quick focused video of the problem
2. Show affected plants, close-up of pests
3. Mention treatment plan
4. Process immediately to document

**Example video narration:**
> "November 13th, quick update. Found aphids on the pepper plants today. [Shows whole pepper plant] You can see them here on the undersides of these leaves [close-up showing aphids]. Mostly on the purple bell peppers, some on the jalapeños. [Pans to show extent] About 4 plants affected.
>
> Picked up neem oil at the store, planning to spray tonight after sunset. Will check again in 3 days."

**AI generates:** Entry focused on the problem with pest identification, affected crops, and treatment plan documented.

**Follow-up video 3 days later:**
> "November 16th, checking on the aphid treatment. [Shows pepper plants] The neem spray worked! No new aphids visible. [Close-ups of leaves] The plants look healthy, just some residual damage on these older leaves where the aphids were."

**Benefit:** Clear problem → treatment → resolution timeline for future reference.

## Workflow 4: Harvest Documentation

**Scenario:** Big harvest day, you want to track quantities.

**Steps:**
1. Harvest as usual
2. Lay out produce organized by type
3. Record quick video panning over harvest
4. Mention quantities as you show each item

**Example video narration:**
> "July 15th harvest. Good day today!
>
> [Shows tomatoes laid out] Cherokee Purple - 8 fruits, about 6 pounds. Early Girl - 12 fruits, maybe 4 pounds. [Close-up] These Cherokee Purples are huge this week.
>
> [Shows cucumbers] Poinsett 76 cucumbers - 15 cucumbers, mostly 6-8 inch size, perfect for pickling.
>
> [Shows peppers] 5 purple bells, 8 jalapeños, 4 poblanos.
>
> [Shows herbs] Big basil harvest, filled this whole bowl, probably 3 cups packed.
>
> Total about 12-15 pounds today. Peak season!"

**AI generates:** Entry with precise harvest quantities, varieties, sizes, and weight estimates. Easy to track productivity over time.

## Workflow 5: Growth Tracking Series

**Scenario:** You want to track a specific plant's growth week by week.

**Setup:**
- Put a labeled stake next to the plant: "Cherokee Purple #1"
- Film from same position each week
- Same time of day (similar lighting)

**Week 1 (April 20):**
> "April 20th, transplant day. Here's Cherokee Purple #1 [shows tag clearly], just transplanted from 4-inch pot. About 8 inches tall. [Hand next to plant for scale] You can see the first true leaves here."

**Week 4 (May 11):**
> "May 11th, checking on Cherokee Purple #1. [Films from same angle] Wow, look at the growth! [Hand for scale] About 24 inches now, three times the size. [Close-up] First flower cluster forming here."

**Week 8 (June 8):**
> "June 8th, Cherokee Purple #1 update. [Same angle] Plant is now about 4 feet tall. [Shows flowers] Multiple flower clusters, some small fruits forming. [Close-up] This one here is about marble-sized."

**Week 12 (July 6):**
> "July 6th, Cherokee Purple #1. [Same angle] Plant is over 5 feet now, staked and caged. [Shows fruits] First fruits ripening, this one will be ready in a day or two."

**AI benefit:** Automatic comparison across entries:
- "Compared to May 11 video, plant has grown from 24 inches to 4+ feet (3 weeks growth)"
- "First fruits visible, development from flower to fruit took ~4 weeks"
- Growth rate tracking for future season planning

## Workflow 6: Treatment Effectiveness Tracking

**Scenario:** Testing a new companion planting or treatment strategy.

**Week 0 (Setup):**
> "Starting experiment: marigolds as aphid deterrent. Planting marigolds between pepper plants in Bed 2. Bed 3 peppers have no marigolds as control. Both beds have similar pepper plants - 3 purple bells, 3 jalapeños each. [Shows both beds]"

**Week 2:**
> "Checking companion planting experiment. [Shows Bed 2] Bed 2 with marigolds - no aphids visible on peppers. Marigolds are flowering nicely. [Shows Bed 3] Bed 3 without marigolds - some aphids appearing on these leaves here. Interesting!"

**Week 4:**
> "Experiment update. [Shows Bed 2] Still no aphids in the marigold bed, peppers are thriving. [Shows Bed 3] Aphids have gotten worse in the control bed, had to treat with neem oil. I think the marigolds are working!"

**AI benefit:** Structured experiment documentation with clear before/during/after comparison.

---

## Workflow 7: Family Collaboration

**Scenario:** Multiple family members record observations.

**Mom's video (morning):**
> "November 16th, morning. I watered everything and noticed the basil is ready for harvest. Also saw what might be early blight on the tomatoes - those brown spots on the lower leaves."

**Dad's video (evening):**
> "Same day, evening check. Harvested the basil Mom mentioned, got about 2 cups. Also picked those 5 tomatoes that were ready. Regarding the tomato spots - looked closer and confirmed it's early blight. Removed affected leaves."

**AI generates:** Combined entry with observations from both, clear timeline of tasks completed, collaborative problem-solving documented.

---

## Workflow 8: Season-End Review

**Scenario:** November, documenting end of season for next year's planning.

**Example video:**
> "November 16th, season wrap-up video.
>
> [Shows tomato plants] Tomatoes are finishing up. The Cherokee Purple performed really well this year - estimated 60-70 pounds total from 3 plants. Early Girl was good but smaller fruits - maybe 40 pounds from 2 plants. Both handled the humid heat better than last year's varieties.
>
> [Shows pepper area] Peppers were the star performers. Purple bells gave us 30+ peppers, jalapeños probably 50+. Would definitely grow these again. The poblanos were slower but good quality.
>
> [Shows empty beds] Cucumbers in this bed struggled again - only got about 20 cucumbers before plants succumbed to downy mildew. Even the Poinsett 76 didn't handle our humidity as well as hoped. Might try a different variety or earlier planting next year.
>
> [Shows basil] Herbs were fantastic all season. Basil, cilantro, parsley all thrived.
>
> Overall assessment: Earlier planting helped a lot vs last year. Humid-heat-tolerant varieties were key. Main lesson: need even better disease prevention for cucurbits, maybe overhead cover to reduce humidity."

**AI generates:** Comprehensive season summary with variety performance, yield estimates, successes and failures, and plans for next year - perfect input for next season's strategy document!

## Tips Across All Workflows

**Consistent elements to mention:**
- Date at start
- Crop/variety names (especially if showing tag)
- Specific observations (not just "looks good")
- Quantities when relevant
- Context ("since last week" / "compared to yesterday")
- Your plan or next steps

**For best AI processing:**
- Name plants as you show them
- Point at specific details while describing
- Include tags/labels in frame when possible
- Mention your own conclusions ("I think this is nitrogen deficiency")
- Show scale (your hand, a ruler, familiar objects)

**Remember:**
- AI is a tool, not perfect - always review and edit entries
- More detail in video = better diary entry
- But even brief videos (1-2 min) create useful entries
- The goal is consistent documentation, not perfection
